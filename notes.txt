overall results 
time of day data we can focus on second load, since we have established that that is the most reliable
TOD -> would be nice to do some exploration. wide plot with all the hours of the day. See if there are
groupngs such as evening morning afternoon.. for loop for each hour of the day. or use box plot
omit the follow location stuff... not needed.



our goal is to isolate round trip time for network time, using pycurl.
separate preconnection time for the rest. 

specify why did we do ping and the other: ping does not go all the way up
the networking stack to the webserver application, immediately replies to you
delay to web server is not captured, where the other one captures it. that
is why ists interesting to have both of them to get where the delay is coming
from. 

add: how many times we ran the cronjob and the frequency.

abstract={The emerging interest in vehicular networks (VANET) led to the deployment of several small and medium-scale testbeds to evaluate the characteristics of this technology in real-world scenarios. Despite this, due to the low availability and high cost of IEEE 802.11p/WAVE fully compliant hardware and software, many of these experiments have been performed with other communication standards, which generate, in many cases, misleading results, that are not representative of real-world vehicular communications. As a mean of solving this problem, this paper presents the implementation and validation of a fully compliant MAC/PHY solution developed in the scope of the DRIVE-IN project, which will be used in a 500-node testbed. Contrarily to what happens with most of the solutions existent in the market, our system complies with the strict channel switching timings using GPS time synchronization, providing access to two different types of wireless channels (e.g. control and service channels as defined in IEEE 1609.4) in a seamless way for the end user. This feature allows safety-critical and control messages to be sent in a dedicated channel, with very low latency, while another channel may be used for less critical services (e.g. infotainment applications, advertisement). The results of the conducted tests show that indeed it is possible to assure the support of critical safety services in the presence of other traffic.},

abstract={When highly mobile nodes are interconnected via wireless links, the resulting network can be used as a transit network to connect other disjoint ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we compare five different opportunistic forwarding schemes, which vary in their overhead, their success rate, and the amount of knowledge about neighboring nodes that they require. In particular, we present the MoVe algorithm, which uses velocity information to make intelligent opportunistic forwarding decisions. Using auxiliary information to make forwarding decisions provides a reasonable trade-off between resource overhead and performance.},

abstract={Channel models for vehicular networks typically disregard the effect of vehicles as physical obstructions for the wireless signal. We aim to clarify the validity of this simplification by quantifying the impact of obstructions through a series of wireless experiments. Using two cars equipped with Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) hardware designed for vehicular use, we perform experimental measurements in order to collect received signal power and packet delivery ratio information in a multitude of relevant scenarios: parking lot, highway, suburban and urban canyon. Upon separating the data into line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) categories, our results show that obstructing vehicles cause significant impact on the channel quality. A single obstacle can cause a drop of over 20 dB in received signal strength when two cars communicate at a distance of 10 m. At longer distances, NLOS conditions affect the usable communication range, effectively halving the distance at which communication can be achieved with 90% chance of success. The presented results motivate the inclusion of vehicles in the radio propagation models used for VANET simulation in order to increase the level of realism.},

   abstract = {Multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle communication is useful for supporting many vehicular applications that provide drivers with safety and convenience. Developing multi-hop communication in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) is a challenging problem due to the rapidly changing topology and frequent network disconnections, which cause failure or inefficiency in traditional ad hoc routing protocols. We propose an adaptive connectivity aware routing (ACAR) protocol that addresses these problems by adaptively selecting an optimal route with the best network transmission quality based on statistical and real-time density data that are gathered through an on-the-fly density collection process. The protocol consists of two parts: 1) select an optimal route, consisting of road segments, with the best estimated transmission quality, and 2) in each road segment of the chosen route, select the most efficient multi-hop path that will improve the delivery ratio and throughput. The optimal route is selected using our transmission quality model that takes into account vehicle densities and traffic light periods to estimate the probability of network connectivity and data delivery ratio for transmitting packets. Our simulation results show that the proposed ACAR protocol outperforms existing VANET routing protocols in terms of data delivery ratio, throughput and data packet delay. Since the proposed model is not constrained by network densities, the ACAR protocol is suitable for both daytime and nighttime city VANET scenarios.},

	abstract = {We present an overview of ad hoc routing protocols that make forwarding decisions based on the geographical position of a packet's destination. Other than the destination's position, each node need know only its own position and the position of its one-hop neighbors in order to forward packets. Since it is not necessary to maintain explicit routes, position-based routing does scale well even if the network is highly dynamic. This is a major advantage in a mobile ad hoc network where the topology may change frequently. The main prerequisite for position-based routing is that a sender can obtain the current position of the destination. Therefore, previously proposed location services are discussed in addition to position-based packet forwarding strategies. We provide a qualitative comparison of the approaches in both areas and investigate opportunities for future research},

   abstract = {One of the major issues that affect the performance of Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANET) is routing. Recently, position-based routing for MANET is found to be a very promising routing strategy for inter-vehicular communication systems (IVCS). However, position-based routing for IVCS in a built-up city environment faces greater challenges because of potentially more uneven distribution of vehicular nodes, constrained mobility, and difficult signal reception due to radio obstacles such as high-rise buildings. This paper proposes a new position-based routing scheme called Anchor-based Street and Traffic Aware Routing (A-STAR), designed specifically for IVCS in a city environment. Unique to A-STAR is the usage of information on city bus routes to identify an anchor path with high connectivity for packet delivery. Along with a new recovery strategy for packets routed to a local maximum, the proposed protocol shows significant performance improvement in a comparative simulation study with other similar routing approaches.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose an algorithm for joint adaptation of transmission power and contention window to improve the performance of vehicular network in a cross layer approach. The high mobility of vehicles in vehicular communication results in the change in topology of the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) dynamically, and the communication link between two vehicles might remain active only for short duration of time. In order for VANET to make a connection for long time and to mitigate adverse effects due to high and fixed transmission power, the proposed algorithm adapts transmission power dynamically based on estimated local traffic density. In addition to that, the prioritization of messages according to their urgency is performed for timely propagation of high priority messages to the destination region. In this paper, we incorporate the contention based MAC protocol 802.11e enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) mechanism to implement a priority-based vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is successful in getting better throughput with lower average end-to-end delay than the algorithm with static/default parameters.},

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme referred as the relative position based message dissemination (RPB-MD), to robustly disseminate messages in VANETs. The relative position based (RPB) addressing model is proposed to define the intended receivers without requiring exterior location service. To achieve robust message dissemination with vehicular traffic independency, RPB-MD adopts the directional greedy broadcast routing approach to forward messages based on position and direction information. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulations. Simulation results show that RPB-MD achieves high delivery ratio, limited overhead and reasonable delay.},

We present two location service protocols, viz., the hierarchical location service protocol and the on-demand location service protocol, to track the position of mobile nodes in a wireless ad hoc network. The hierarchical location service uses a location-based hierarchy to maintain the location of nodes in the network, whereas the on-demand location service uses a unicast-based network probing, unlike flooding, to obtain the position of a node on-demand. In the unicast-based network probing, a location query for a node is unicast to nodes that are closer to a few fixed positions in the network. For a given network size, the number of such positions remains constant. Both the location service protocols use a heuristic greedy forwarding protocol, called the angular routing protocol, to circumvent dead ends, and to route packets beyond one hop. We use a theoretical framework to show that both the location service protocols are asymptotically scalable with respect to the number of nodes in the network. Further, we present results from an extensive simulation study comparing the performance of the proposed on-demand location service protocol with LAR1 and a combination of GPSR-GLS. Simulations show that the on-demand location service along with angular routing protocol outperforms the LAR1 and GPSR-GLS protocol in terms of control overhead, percentage of packets delivered, and average hop count, for various network scenarios."

abstract={Antenna diversity is a well-known technique used to improve the quality and reliability of a wireless link. In vehicular networks, a different approach to antenna diversity is needed due to their unique channel characteristics. However, this issue has not been actively researched, especially for the positioning of antennas. In this paper, we highlight the benefit of vertical diversity over traditional horizontal diversity techniques in vehicular network environments. Through experiments using IEEE 802.11a radios in the 5.2GHz band, we first show the difference of attenuation patterns from various antenna positions installed in a vehicle, then we show the benefit of vertical diversity by quantifying the diversity gains and combined error rates. This finding has implications for the future position of antenna installation in vehicles.},

abstract={This paper examines the spatial correlation of packet loss events in IEEE 802.11 wireless networks for broadcast communications. We discuss limitations of previously used metrics to measure spatial loss correlation and show that the entropy correlation coefficient, which is based on the mutual information concept of Information Theory, can overcome these limitations. In our experiments, we find that the packet losses among closely located receivers are highly correlated when signal strength is high, but the correlation decreases with decreasing signal strength. The losses become totally independent once the signal strength falls below a threshold. As a first step to model the relationship between spatial loss correlation and signal strength, we find that the relationship can be approximated as a Gaussian cumulative distribution function.},

abstract={One of the most challenging research issues in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is how to efficiently relay messages between vehicles. We propose a heuristic that uses the physical dimensions of vehicles to help determine whether or not a vehicle is an appropriate next hop. We base the heuristic on the intuition that taller vehicles have an advantage over shorter ones because the former are less susceptible to shadowing from other vehicles. We implement a model that evaluates the efficacy of the proposed heuristic and we perform the experiments to validate the model. Based on both the experimental measurements and the simulations performed using the model, it is shown that tall vehicles consistently and significantly increase both the effective communication range and the message reachability. The effective communication range increased by more than 50%: from 290 meters when short vehicles are communicating to 450 meters in the case of tall vehicles. The results suggest that, when available, tall vehicles are significantly more likely to better relays than short vehicles. The proposed heuristic is not dependent on any specific routing technique and can be used to improve the performance of different classes of routing protocols.},

abstract={In this paper we present empirical results from a study examining the effects of antenna diversity and placement on vehicle-to-vehicle link performance in vehicular ad hoc networks. The experiments use roof- and in-vehicle mounted omni-directional antennas and IEEE 802.11a radios operating in the 5 GHz band, which is of interest for planned inter-vehicular communication standards. Our main findings are two-fold. First, we show that radio reception performance is sensitive to antenna placement in the 5 Ghz band. Second, our results show that, surprisingly, a packet level selection diversity scheme using multiple antennas and radios, multi-radio packet selection (MRPS), improves performance not only in a fading channel but also in line-of-sight conditions. This is due to propagation being affected by car geometry, leading to the highly non-uniform antenna patterns. These patterns are very sensitive to the exact antenna position on the roof, for example at a transmit power of 40 mW the line-of-sight communication range varied between 50 and 250 m depending on the orientation of the cars. These findings have implications for vehicular MAC protocol design. Protocols may have to cope with an increased number of hidden nodes due to the directional antenna patterns. However, car makers can reduce these effects through careful antenna placement and diversity.},

abstract={We present a realistic, yet computationally inexpensive simulation model for IEEE 802.11p radio shadowing in urban environments. Based on real world measurements using IEEE 802.11p/DSRC devices, we estimated the effect that buildings and other obstacles have on the radio communication between vehicles. Especially for evaluating safety applications in the field of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs), stochastic models are not sufficient for evaluating the radio communication in simulation. Motivated by similar work on WiFi measurements, we therefore created an empirical model for modeling buildings and their properties to accurately simulate the signal propagation. We validated our model using real world measurements in a city scenario for different types of obstacles. Our simulation results show a very high accuracy when compared with the measurement results, while only requiring a marginal overhead in terms of computational complexity.},

abstract = "An ad hoc network is composed of mobile nodes without the presence of a fixed infrastructure. Communications among nodes are accomplished by forwarding data packets for each other, on a hop-by-hop basis along the current connection to the destination node. In particular, vehicle-to-vehicle communications have been studied, in recent years, to improve driver safety. As more of such applications of high-mobility ad hoc networks emerge, it is critical that the routing protocol employed is capable of efficiently coping with the high-frequency of broken links (i.e., robust with respect to high-mobility). This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study in a city environment of eight representative routing protocols for wireless mobile ad hoc networks and inter-vehicular networks developed in recent years. In a city environment, communication protocols need adapt fast moving nodes (e.g., vehicles on streets) and large obstacles (e.g., office buildings). In this paper, we elaborate upon extensive simulation results based on various network scenarios, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques with regard to their support for highly mobile nodes."

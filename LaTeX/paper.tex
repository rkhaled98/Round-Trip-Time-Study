\title{Experimental study on round trip times of web applications}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% The introduction is very important. By the time the reviewer finishes the 
% introduction, he probably has his mind made up already: he'll read the rest 
% of the paper looking for evidence to support his decision.

% what is the problem and why is it importantly
% why is the problem hard?
% what is wrong with existing solutions?
% what do we propose to do and why is it better (i.e. what are our contributions)?

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

% explain what we've done in order to ensure reproducibility

Collection of data was conducted using two Python libraries: pyping and PycURL. PycURL is a Python interface to libcurl, which is a client-side URL transfer library. PycURL allows one to fetch various objects identified by a URL: in our case, objects corresponding to the URLs of various websites hosted on servers across the world. [1]

First, we wanted to calculate the RTT as measured by a calculation involving, at the highest level, a websiteâ€™s pretransfer time and time to first byte: the RTT was calculated as the pretransfer time subtracted from the time to first byte, both of which were obtained with PycURL. Knowing this, it is as simple as creating a new Curl Object from PycURL, setting the relevant options, i.e. the name of the website and the FOLLOWLOCATION to 1. Setting the FOLLOWLOCATION to 1 tells the library to follow any Location: header that the server sends as part of a HTTP header in a 3xx response. The Location: header can specify a relative or an absolute URL to follow. The library will issue another request for the new URL and follow new Location: headers all the way until no more such headers are returned. [2]
